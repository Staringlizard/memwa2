*** Building software:

1. Download the gnu arm cross compiler package
2. Download memwa2 source code from github
3. Extract everything and enter folder memwa2
4. Modify PATH variable to include the bin folder for cross compiler
5. Make
6. Done

*** Flashing software:

1. Copy the file ./out_target/target.bin to the root directory on the sdcard
2. Insert the SD card and startup hardware
3. New firmware will automatically start flash procedure if firmware file is found
4. If software is flashed successfully the target.bin file will be removed

*** SD card:

There are some folders that can be added to the sdcard
in order to configure the software and to run programs.

"conf" folder

  "key.cfg" file

    This file contain entries like this -> "2A:0,0". This specific entry
    means that the USB scan code 2A (back space) should be mapped
    to the commodore key matrix equivalent of 0 and 0. In other words
    the CIA1 IC portA bit 0 and CIA1 portB bit 0 will have a connection.

  "palette.cfg" file

    This file contains all c64 colors in RGB888 format. In addition to this
    it also contains 3 extra colors that are used for text background,
    text forground and marker.

      Contains the basic rom.

    "cc_crom.bin"

      Contains the char rom.

    "cc_krom.bin"

      Contains the kernal rom.

    "dd_dos.bin"

      Contains the disk drive rom.

"res" folder

  Contains the bitmaps used in menu.

*** Startup:

1. Unzip the sdcard.zip file onto an sdcard
2. Insert sdcard into memwa2 board
3. Power on
